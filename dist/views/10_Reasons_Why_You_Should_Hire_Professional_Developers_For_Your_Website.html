	<p>Now, I should start off by saying I might be <i>a little</i> biased writing this article, seeing that I consider myself a "Professional Developer". However, After you read these 10 reasons down below, hopefully you will have a better understanding of what advantages come from building custom websites vs using a cheaper, template based drag-and-drop website builder.</p>

			<h4>CUSTOM DESIGNS</h4>
			<div>A web development professional can design any form of a website that even you can’t imagine as well as they have the expertise in solving technical problems. No matter how complex the task will be in between although they can sort out every single issue with new ideas or tactics. However, the design is one of the core elements to building a site for example if your website doesn’t have a design backdrop it may look unattractive or unorganized.</div>

			<h4>IT CAN SAVE YOUR TIME</h4>
			<div>Creating a website is not that simple process to do because you have to do comprehensive planning. That is how your site is going to structure, what kind of design you will use as well as the actual expansion of all its functionality. Hence by hiring an experienced developer will save your time as he or she will be prearranged and know how to manage the whole process without needing to look back. So if you are starting a new business and required a well-organized site, then you only need to hire a high-quality skilled web developer.</div>
